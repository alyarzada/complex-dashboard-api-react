## Project Overview

During my work, i successfully undertook the task of transforming a "Dashboard" typed vanilla.js project into a fully-fledged React.js app from the ground up. I had the opportunity to gain real-world experience with various complex client-side concepts such as role-based user authorization, localizing, intricate UI components (data-tables, date-pickers, calendars, charts and more). Furthermore, the project was seamlessly integrated with a RESTful API.
